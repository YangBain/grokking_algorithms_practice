# Grokking Algorithms Code

Code to implement the algorithms mentioned in book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/bhargava).

I took reference from the [official repository](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms) to name my folders.

Also, one image from [official repository](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms) is used in here.

## Notice

- Under the folder of each chapter includes a `README.md` file that records my notes for that chapter, and is written in Chinese(每章文件夹中都包含有中文笔记).
- My implementation might be diffrent from that in book, it's constructed in a more undestandable way.
