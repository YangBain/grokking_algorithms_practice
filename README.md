# Grokking Algorithms Code

Code to implement the algorithms mentioned in book [Grokking Algorithms](https://www.manning.com/bhargava).

I took reference from the [official repository](https://github.com/egonSchiele/grokking_algorithms) to name my folders.

## Algorithms List

- [x] 01.Binary search.
- [x] 02.Selection sort.
- [x] 03.Recursion.
- [x] 04.Quicksort.

## Notice

- Under the folder of each chapter includes a `README.md` file that records my notes for that chapter, and is written in Chinese(每章文件夹中都包含有中文笔记).
- My implementation might be a bit diffrent from that in book, but it runs okay and share same structures as the authentic one.
